command structure for kernel access, not reliant on fio
command buffer
fire and block
fire and forget

no idea what those are ^

message passing
expose kernel font somehow (broadcast message and kernel replies?)
^ done-ish temp file that gives the font when read

sleeping
wait queue, sleep until time is met? maybe that works!
